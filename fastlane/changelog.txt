This latest update improves the use of certain skills. Now we will display how much damage you do to a boss right when you use a skill like Brutal Smash. The list of tasks that displays when you use a skill will only show viable tasks as well now. Weâ€™ve also made some improvements to the mini notifications you receive when getting an item or level up, clarified the reason given for equipment being locked, and fixed a few pesky bugs in the process. Hope you enjoy!
