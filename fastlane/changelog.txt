New in 4.6.0
- Improvements to reminder scheduling to help them appear on time
- Reminders should no longer appear if a task isn't due that day
- Your avatar now shows at the top of the screen when choosing equipment, letting you see how you look as you try gear on!
- We made it easier to choose what to do with tasks from broken Challenges so they don't get stuck on your task list
- You'll now be able to leave your Party if you're participating in an active Quest
