Highlights include changes to Settings including easier language selection, fixes for the class selection screen, improvements to the Time Travelers’ Shop, and fixes for Challenge loading, To-Do reminders, and the Record Yesterday’s Activity modal. We’ve also made it easier to find the Habitica Help Guild and the Party Wanted Guild.
