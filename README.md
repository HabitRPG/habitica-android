## Build Instructions

### Config Files

1. Setup Habitica build config files by simply copying or renaming the example habitica files:

   `habitica.properties.example` to `habitica.properties`

   `habitica.resources.example` to `habitica.resources`

   You also need `google-services.json`. Download it from Firebase in the next step.



2. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com

   a. Register/Login to Firebase. (You can use a Google account.)

   b. Create a new project called Habitica

   c. Create two apps in the project: `com.habitrpg.android.habitica` and `com.habitrpg.android.habitica.debug`

   d. Creating each app will generate a `google-services.json` file. Download the `google-services.json` file from the second app and put it in `\Habitica\`

   You can skip the last part of the app creation wizards (where you run the app to verify installation).



3. If using Android Studio, click Sync Project with Gradle Files. Update Android Studio if it asks you to update. Run Habitica.
