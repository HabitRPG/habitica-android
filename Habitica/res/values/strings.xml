    <string name="health_points">Health Points</string>
    <string name="health_description">This represents your avatar’s life. Missing a Daily or doing a negative Habit **reduces your HP**.\n\n**Regain HP** by leveling up, using a Health Potion, or a class skill with healing ability.\n\nIf your **HP reaches 0** you will lose a level, all Gold, and one piece of equipment. Lost equipment can be re-purchased.</string>
    <string name="experience_points">Experience Points</string>
    <string name="experience_description">Experience points represent your progress and allow you to level up. You’ll mainly **gain EXP** from completing tasks or quests, but there are also some class skills that give EXP.\n\nTasks of higher difficulty, or red-colored tasks will give you **more EXP**. The **Intelligence stat** also raises your rate of EXP gain.</string>
    <string name="mana_points">Mana Points</string>
    <string name="gold_description">Gold is the **main form of currency** within Habitica and allows you to buy certain gear, quests, items, or even custom rewards you make for yourself.\n\n**Earn Gold** through completing tasks or quests, or through some Class skills. Higher **Perception stats** raise the amount of Gold you earn.\n\nIf you subscribe to Habitica, you can even use Gold to purchase a number of Gems determined by the length of time you’ve been subscribed.</string>
    <string name="mana_description">Mana points are unlocked with the class system at level 10 and allow you to **use Skills** once you begin learning them at level 11.\n\nSome **MP is restored** at day reset every day, but you can regain more by completing tasks or using a Mage class skill.</string>
    <string name="stat_allocation">Stat Allocation</string>
    <string name="stat_description">All Habitica characters have four stats that affect the gameplay aspects of Habitica.\n\n**Strength (STR)** affects critical hits and raises damage done to a Quest Boss. Warriors and Rogues gain STR from their class equipment.\n\n**Constitution (CON)** raises your HP and makes you take less damage. Healers and Warriors gain CON from their class equipment.\n\n**Intelligence (INT)** raises the amount of EXP you earn and gives you more Mana. Mages and Healers gain INT from their class equipment.\n\n**Perception (PER)** increases the gold you earn and the rate of finding dropped items. Rogues and Mages gain PER from their class equipment.\n\nAfter level 10, you earn 1 Stat Point every level you gain that you can put into any stat you’d like. You can also equip gear that has different combinations of stat boosts.</string>
